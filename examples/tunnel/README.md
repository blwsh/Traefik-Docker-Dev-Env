# Tunnel Example

You may sometimes need to expose your application to the internet but are unable to open a port on your local network.

Using deployment.run or similar services such as ngrok we can expose out service using an SSH tunnel.

URLS:

* tunnel.whoami.local.blw.sh - Local url
* whoami.local.deployment.run - Tunnel url
